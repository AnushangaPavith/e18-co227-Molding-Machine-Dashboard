# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Scripts

First, You have to create a project directory
### `npx create-react-app my-app`
### `cd my-app`

You must install following libraries:
### `npm i react-router-dom`
### `npm i react-icons`
### `npm i @material-ui/core`

Then replace your "src" directory with this directory.

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
